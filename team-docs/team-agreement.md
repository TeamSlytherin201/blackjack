## What will be your groups process to resolve conflict

As a group we will be utilizing a daily standup to start each day, which one of the conversation pieces will be blockers and may cover a lot of the conflicts before they become an issue. Additionally, team lead will be available for speaking to 1 on 1s to air any issues and get a resolution. As team lead, Jonathan will work to handle conflicts that may arise between one person's feature needing another person's feature to work and that feature not being done yet, to include pair programming with the one that's needed to get up to speed. 

## Handle challenges knowing not everyone has the same understanding and skill levels

To start, we will take on tasks that are our strengths until we have an MVP. Once we've achieved an MVP, then we will encourage each other to work on tasks that are a weakness to grow, while avoiding it affecting delays inhibiting presenting on Friday.

## Handle concerns of those who aren't contributing adequately

If we notice someone is not contributing, we will have a one on one with the person to try to find out the issue. If it's a problem that can be solved, like they aren't sure what to do or how to do something, we can offer solutions. If it's something like the person just doesn't want to do work, then it will be elevated past the team. If someone's struggling with a piece someone else needs and the person needs a lot of time, the person who's waiting can get moved to another feature while they catch up.


We have all agreed that we are here to work for the duration of this program. We will be available from 9am to 11pm every day, excluding this first weekend, with a lunch break from 12-1. We also feel we are adults and can manage our break times ourselves. This will be re-evaluated on Wednesday if it's an issue and may set times if so. It is encouraged to speak up if there's any issues and get advice without fear of judgement. If someone is having a bad day, let others know as being virtually connected is harder to read people and knowing can help prevent conflicts before they begin. Through our daily standups, everyone will have equal amounts of time to speak, so everyone can feel heard. 

We will be utilizing daily standup meetings and trello for feature progress tracking as well as to have a way to see how your own work plays into the big picture and that you're contributing. 

We have a development branch for the individual branches to get merged into, requiring one approval to complete. The main branch will require two approvals to merge in the development branch.
