      <p class= "large">First time playing Blackjack? No problem! Blackjack is a fun and simple way to gain or lose a lot of money very quickly! Ours is a simplified version that allows you to first, enter you name. That way we can keep track of your wins, occasional losses, and your all time record so you can see how your skills measure up against other players! Fun! Next you’ll be given a set amount of money to gamble with. Since this is an olde fashioned  Blackjack game, there is no limit to how much of your money you can bet: 1 dollar or all of your dollars at once. Go broke faster than ever!</p>

      <p class= "large">Make your bet and then you will be dealt two cards that everyone can see, we promise. The goal is to build a hand that is as close to the numerical value of ’21’ as possible without going over or you BUST. Watch out though; the dealer is trying to get to ’21’ as well. Card values are the displayed number 1-10, 10 for all face cards, and either 11 or 1 for Aces. The Dealer then then deals themself two cards, one of which you can see. Use the knowledge of what the dealer is showing in conjunction with what your cards are to choose one of 2 actions: HIT, or STAND.</p>
      
      <p class= "small">HIT will deal you another card, which you will add to the value of your first two cards.</p>
      
      <p class= "small">STAND will leave your cards as they are and then the dealer will continue play until they have a number higher than 17, at which point you will compare hands and decide a winner.</p>
      
  
      
      <p class="large">You continue to bet and play your hands until you BUST, or run out of money. If you BUST, you can buy back in and continue playing, or not: it is up to YOU! Your record of busts will be recorded for you, so that your shame can be public. The point is to have fun!</p>
